## Monetizing Data Products {transition="none-out"}

<br> 

What is a "Data Product"?

<br>

> A data product is a piece of software that delivers data to an end consumer in a way that provides value to them.

::: {.notes}
- < Tell podcast / Tom Davenport / CDO vs. CDAO officer story >
- How do we monetize our data?  We have to build something that customers (either internal or external customers) find useful
- Let's focus on that third word from the end of the quote: "value"; what makes a data valuable?

## Monetizing Data Products {transition="none-in"}

<br>

Data provides value when it is:

::: {.incremental}
1. Accurate
2. Relevant
2. Timely
:::

::: {.notes}
- Data provides value when it is accurate, relevant, and timely
- Notice the very first point -- *"accurate"*
  + This is all predicated on the fact that we have good data in the first place
  + Data governance *enables* the possibility for monetizing your data, because no one (internal or external) is going to "buy" your data product if it can't get them *accurate* data, that's *relevant* to them, at the *time* they need it 
:::

## Types of Data Products

::: {.incremental}
- Dashboards / web applications
- API services
- Productionized Machine Learning
:::

::: {.notes}
- There are 3 types of data products that we use to "monetize" data for the organizations we work with
  + Dashboards / web applications
  + API services
  + Productionized Machine Learning
- What we are going to do in the next few minutes is walk through actual, practical use cases & examples of each of these types of data products
:::

## Dashboards / Web Applications {.smaller}

- Underestimated communication tool
- Time-savings for analysts
- Reinforces importance of data quality

::: {.notes}
- I've been the analyst who management comes to with a question, and I answer it, and then they say, "Well what about if we sliced the data this way?", and it becomes analysis paralysis
- A dashboard with a few filter widgets on it can be a great way to free up time for your analyst and answer more questions, faster, for your management & decision-makers 
- Sometimes descriptive analytics (telling you what has happened based upon your historical data) can be even *more* valuable than predictive analytics (trying to guess what's going to happen in the future)
- Your users are entering data into the front-end of your internal applications, but if you are not providing them with dashboards and insights into the data that they've spent all this time entering & collecting, then it can be hard for them to feel incentivized to correctly enter that data in the first place -- leading back to data quality issues and data governance issues

## API Services {transition="slide-in none-out"}

- Customer-facing or internal facing

::: {.notes}
- Google is a great example of this, their Maps API is used by many (including Ketchbrook) for geo-coding w/ Market Magnify
- We have a client who is a target marketing firm, and they get a ton of customer account data from their bank clients each month. This enables them to do some benchmarking (e.g., this person with an account at your bank is in the top 13% of all customers in the U.S. in terms of their savings account balance)
- Here's an example from one of our clients who provides a benchmarking API service that we helped build out for banks to consume within their CRM platform

## Machine Learning {transition="none-out"}

- Data enables the *possibility* of ML

**Example ML use cases**: 

::: {.incremental}
- Automated Lending
- Target Marketing
- Customer Churn
- Insurance Pricing
:::

::: {.notes}
- Just because we have data in a database somewhere, doesn't automatically mean that we can start doing machine learning -- it needs to start with a use case, and then we either have the data available to solve that business problem with ML, or we need to go and get it
- Some example use cases include:
  + automated lending
  + target marketing
  + customer churn
  + insurance pricing
:::

## Machine Learning {transition="none-in"}

<img src="www/model_as_api.png">

::: {.notes}
When we think of productionizing machine learning we really think about doing that two ways:
  - wrapping up the model inside a REST API so that it can be used for on-demand predictions
- So let's use the automated lending example [walk through diagram]
