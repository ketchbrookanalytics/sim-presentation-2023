This enables them to do some benchmarking (e.g., this person with an account at your bank is in the top 13% of all customers in the U.S. in terms of their savings account balance)\nHere’s an example from one of our clients who provides a benchmarking API service that we helped build out for banks to consume within their CRM platform"
